        <br>Here are some of the relevant skills that I have and applied them that will help Twiga Foods
        <br>HTML/CSS and JavaScript -I  used the mentioned skills to create a web application that allows uses to to order food and shows the food ordered is successfully added to their cart
        <br>UX Research-This helps me to understand the user needs and how to choose the best methodologies for testing the product before releasing to the market
        <br>Python skills -  I have been practicing  on data structures that are used to store data in databases and make it easy to restore
        <br>Product Management that I have used to make user stories and track my progress as I build the food project
        <br>
